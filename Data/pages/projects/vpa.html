        VPA is project I have contributed to in the past, but am no longer involved in. It is written in C++, and utilizes the Qt framework with the Vulkan API.
        <br>
        <br>
        VPA was produced as a solution for the problem of having to write hard-coded data for the generation of different graphics pipelines when using the Vulkan API. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The way it solves this problem is by producing configuration files which contain the information required to generate graphical pipelines, which can in turn be loaded into engines which utilize Vulkan, resulting in the production of pipelines without the programmer having to hard-code any pipeline values.
        <br>
        <br>
        The project is currently still under development, primarily by <a href="https://qozul.github.io/" target="_blank">Ralph Ridley</a>, and its progress can be followed on either github or the <a href ="https://trello.com/b/80TA000E/vpa" target="_blank">trello</a> board, which is continuously being updated.
