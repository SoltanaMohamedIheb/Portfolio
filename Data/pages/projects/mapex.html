        Flocked is a virtual reality (VR) multiplayer game set in space, where two colonies, Earth and Mars, are in conflict. Each colony has its base with tasks to complete, yielding resources that can be used to craft spaceship components.        <br>
        <br>
        The game has two main mechanics: completing tasks inside the base and dogfighting in space using spaceships.        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, the game offers a challenging and immersive VR experience that blends task completion and space combat, set against a backdrop of inter-colonial conflict        <br>
        <br>
        Our game project was awarded one of the Best Projects at the University Projects Event 2023        <br>
