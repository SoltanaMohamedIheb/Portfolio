<div id="tech_title">AntVenture</div>

<div id="tech_quote">"Antventure" is an engaging Unity game that challenges players to take on the role of an industrious ant tasked with collecting food for their queen. This unique game leverages the A* algorithm, a popular pathfinding algorithm, to guide the ant on its quest through the intricate and immersive ant colony environment.</div>

        This project was completed as a AI coursework during my final year. The aim within the game is to collect objects and bring them back to the player's spawn island without being caught by the AI, based on the Untitled Goose Game.

        I definitely feel that working on the AI resonated with me the most, I implemented hierarchical state machines for my complex AI, and a simple state machine for a basic version of the AI (as requested by the specification). 
        However, the section of which I am most proud of is my implementation for precomputed A* maps, I was the only student in my class to attempt this method, and it worked tremendously well! Combined with pre-processing map data into files, this resulted in a constant cost of A* path calculation during run-time, which allowed me to include a very large number of AI units.
