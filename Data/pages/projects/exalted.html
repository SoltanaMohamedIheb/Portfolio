        In the final year of their software engineering program, a dedicated team of five students embarked on a creative journey to develop an immersive role-playing game (RPG) using Unreal Engine. 
        This ambitious project seamlessly combines cutting-edge technology with intricate storytelling. Set in a dynamic universe merging a futuristic cyberpunk world with the ancient splendor of the Roman Empire, 
        the game offers players a unique experience of time travel. As protagonists navigate through this captivating blend of eras, they encounter an innovative moral system that shapes the outcome of their choices. 
        The game features a sophisticated combat system, intricate stealth mechanisms, and a comprehensive inventory system. With stunning visual and sound effects, the RPG also boasts a dynamic dialogue system, 
        enriching player interactions with non-playable characters (NPCs). Engaging puzzles and challenges are strategically scattered throughout the game, prompting players to utilize both their intellectual and
        combat skills to progress. The inclusion of advanced enemy AI ensures that players face formidable adversaries, adding an extra layer of challenge to this compelling RPG adventure.
