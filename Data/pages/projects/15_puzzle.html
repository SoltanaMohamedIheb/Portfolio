        Developed in collaboration with my designer friend Moez at the Global Game Jam Tunisia 2024, Climboy is an engaging 2D platformer game that challenges players to navigate through whimsically perilous landscapes while being entertained by its comedic elements. Our goal was to blend engaging gameplay with humor, making each level not just a challenge but also a source of laughter and joy.
        <br>
        <br>
        My contributions focused on scripting in Unity using C#, integrating Moez's creative designs, and ensuring that the game mechanics supported our vision of combining fun with a good laugh. This project was not only a testament to our shared passion for game development but also an opportunity to contribute to the vibrant gaming community with a game that embodies creativity and fun.
