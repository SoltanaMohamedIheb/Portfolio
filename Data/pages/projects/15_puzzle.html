        Event: Global Game Jam Tunisia 2024
        <br>
        <br>
        Climboy is a 2D platformer game developed as part of the Global Game Jam Tunisia 2024, under the "Make Me Laugh" theme. Conceived and developed alongside my designer friend Moez, Climboy challenges players to navigate through whimsically perilous landscapes, all while tickling their funny bone.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our development process was driven by the ambition to blend engaging gameplay with comedic elements, ensuring each level not only presented a challenge but also a story that made players chuckle. The use of Unity and C# allowed us to craft dynamic levels, quirky characters, and hilarious scenarios that truly brought our "Make Me Laugh" theme to life.
        <br>
        <br>
        I was responsible for the game's programming, working closely with Moez to ensure the design and game mechanics seamlessly integrated humor with playability. Together, we iterated on feedback from early playtests to fine-tune the balance between difficulty and entertainment.
        <br>
        <br>
        Climboy stands as a testament to our combined skills and passion for game development, embodying the joy and creativity of the Global Game Jam experience.
